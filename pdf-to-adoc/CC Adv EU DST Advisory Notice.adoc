CalConnect calls on EU to reconsider timeline for proposed seasonal time
changes
____

Workshop and mailing list announced for discussion of technical impact

Summary

The European Commission has proposed, after public consultation, that
its member states discontinue seasonal changes of time, effective
October 2019. The member states must decide how to implement the
proposed change before April 1st 2019. Several governments and
organizations have since expressed concerns on such a tight timeline for
the far-reaching change.

​(CalConnect) a global non-profit organization shares these concerns, and
recommends the European Commission extend the timelines specified in the
proposal.

Specifically, we recommend providing a transition period of at least one
year (12 months) after the final decision of the change has been set.
CalConnect will host a public workshop on the proposed EU changes at its
next conference in early February 2019, and has recently launched a
public mailing list for the discussion of best practices for planning
new time zone changes.

The European Commission’s Proposal

The European Commission has proposed requiring European Union (EU)
member states to decide whether to permanently keep summer or winter
time by 1 April 2019. (​ ​​​ ).​ For countries opting for permanent winter
time, the last daylight-saving time change will occur in October 2019.

This proposal was made in response to the corresponding public
consultation that ended in August 2018, where the majority of
participating EU citizens voted to abandon daylight saving time in the
EU.

____
Specifically, the timeline specified in this proposal only gives EU
member states 6 months of lead time from the decision date of March 2019
(since the adoption date is set to 1 April 2019) to the effective date
of October 2019.

Our concerns

CalConnect is concerned insufficient notice has been provided to EU
member states to make their decisions and implement changes. CalConnect
is deeply aware of potential repercussions of such a change with short
notice. Our membership is comprised of technology vendors and end-user
organizations focused on the areas of date and time, calendaring,
scheduling, and for more than a decade, time zone issues.

CalConnect’s experience from similar DST changes in the past indicates
that such changes pose serious risks to the accuracy of stored
time-related data and schedules (such as meetings, appointments, flights
and transit schedules).

Users of services and products that depend on correct time zone
information -- universities, companies of all sizes, and many other
types of organizations, as well as their suppliers -- will face a major
challenge to assess which software and hardware is vulnerable, and to
implement mitigation measures.

While customers need adequate time for budgeting, procurement, and
installation of upgrades or replacements for this change, vendors also
need time to implement and test product changes, all the while under
pressure to meet market needs and fulfill regulatory compliance. An
extended timeline will benefit all parties.

Change management

Serious technical and operational problems can occur when insufficient
time is allowed for time zone changes.

Over the last decade, a number of time zone related changes performed
were enforced in diverse areas without consideration of best practices
and adequate planning, leaving user

organizations, especially small and medium businesses, scrambling and
suffering from the effects of using incorrect time zone information.

We strongly suggest extending the effective implementation date of
October 2019 to March 2020, allowing a transition period of at one year
from the decision deadline of March 2019. This would provide consumer
and technology vendors alike ample time to implement the necessary
changes.

What CalConnect is doing to help the transition

CalConnect is pursuing a number of initiatives in order to assist policy
makers and IT specialists in implementing the proposed time zone
changes.

Public workshop

CalConnect is organizing a public workshop on the EU proposal to abandon
seasonal time change at our next conference in Zurich, Switzerland (Feb
4-8, 2019).

We call on all stakeholders (e.g., vendors, consumers, policymakers)
interested in, or affected by this Directive, to​​​ and participate in the
workshop.

Time zone distribution standard

Our members have created the standard for​​​ (IETF RFC 7808). Today, most
services and devices still rely on patching and manually updating time
zone information instead of automated or dynamic updates.

We recommend the European Commission strongly support adoption of
relevant open standards, and encourage its member states to collaborate
with each other as well as the international standards bodies.

Coordinated global effort with ISO/TC 154

We are working closely with other standards-setting organizations
(including ISO/TC 154 and UNECE) to harmonize time zone data and time
zone distribution internationally.

We recommend regional standards bodies in the European Union, such as​​​
and ​,​ and standards bodies in its member states participate in this
global partnership.
