Background: This is Calconnect’s third Interop.

Interop test events are open to members and non-members. They involve
developers of Calendaring and Scheduling products or implementations
that are based upon Calendaring and Scheduling standards and open
specifications, in particular the IETF iCal, iMIP and iTIP RFCs and
related drafts. At the events, implementers test their implementations
for accuracy in implementing the Calendaring and Scheduling +
Standards, and test interoperability with other implementations. Goals
of the Interops include assessing the C&S standards, assessing the
implementations, and determining interoperability.
