Kerio Technologies To Host CalConnect’s Mobile Calendaring and Scheduling 
Interoperability Testing Event in Europe 
 
Limited Number of Slots Still Available for November 2008 Event in Kerio’s Czech Republic Office 
 
July 28, 2008 - The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (www.calconnect.org) will hold its second 
Mobile Calendaring Interoperability Test Event on November 4-6, 2008 at Kerio Technologies offices in 
the Czech Republic.  The following CalConnect members have expressed a decided interest in 
participation in a  series of interoperability tests focused on mobile calendaring data exchange:  IBM, 
Kerio Technologies, Inc., Microsoft, Scalix, Sony Ericsson, Symbian, and Synchronica. 
 
“There are significant challenges in mobile calendaring today,” said Dave Thewlis, CalConnect’s 
Executive Director.  “The synchronization protocols used to ‘sync’ mobile device data are not sensitive to 
the validity of the data, only the data were transmitted successfully.  As a result, regular synchronization 
testing cannot detect or resolve application-level errors. CalConnect’s Mobile Calendar Interoperability 
Test Suite has been developed to simplify testing of the real calendar data, and the capabilities of 
different mobile devices. It will test what calendaring data the mobile devices receive and deliver data to 
the user.” 
 
Participation is open to non-members as well as members of CalConnect.  To register for the 
interoperability testing event, please contact Dave Thewlis (dave.thewlis@calconnect.org) or Chris 
Dudding (chris.dudding@symbian.com).  
 
CalConnect will also hold a regular (non-mobile) interoperability test event as an adjunct to its 
Roundtable members’ meeting on October 6-10, 2008 at Yahoo! in Sunnyvale, California. Non-members 
wishing to participate or observe should contact Dave Thewlis. More details on the event can be found 
at the CalConnect website beginning in early August.
