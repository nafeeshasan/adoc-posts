*Kerio Technologies To Host CalConnect’s Mobile Calendaring and
Scheduling Interoperability Testing Event in Europe*

_Limited Number of Slots Still Available for November 2008 Event in
Kerio’s Czech Republic Office_

July 28, 2008 - The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium will hold its
second Mobile Calendaring Interoperability Test Event on November 4-6,
2008 at Kerio Technologies offices in the Czech Republic. The following
CalConnect members have expressed a decided interest in participation in
a series of interoperability tests focused on mobile calendaring data
exchange: IBM, Kerio Technologies, Inc., Microsoft, Scalix, Sony
Ericsson, Symbian, and Synchronica.

“There are significant challenges in mobile calendaring today,” said
Dave Thewlis, CalConnect’s Executive Director. “The synchronization
protocols used to ‘sync’ mobile device data are not sensitive to the
validity of the data, only the data were transmitted successfully. As a
result, regular synchronization testing cannot detect or resolve
application-level errors. CalConnect’s Mobile Calendar Interoperability
Test Suite has been developed to simplify testing of the real calendar
data, and the capabilities of different mobile devices. It will test
what calendaring data the mobile devices receive and deliver data to the
user.”

Participation is open to non-members as well as members ohe
interoperntact Dave Thewlis or Chris Dudding .

CalConnect will also hold a regular (non-mobile) interoperability test
event as an adjunct to its Roundtable members’ meeting on October 6-10,
2008 at Yahoo! in Sunnyvale, California. Non-members wishing to
participate or observe should contact Dave Thewlis. More details on the
event can be found at the CalConnect website beginning in early August.

*The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (www.calconnect.org)* +
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (CalConnect) is a partnership
among vendors, developers, and customers to advance calendaring and
scheduling standards and implementations. The mission is to provide
mechanisms to allow calendaring and scheduling methodologies to
interoperate, and to promote broad understanding of these methodologies
so that calendaring and scheduling tools and applications can enter the
mainstream of computing. The Consortium develops recommendations for
improvement and extension of relevant standards, develops requirements
and use cases for calendaring
