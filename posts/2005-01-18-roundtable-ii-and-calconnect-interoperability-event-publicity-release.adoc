Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium Interop Features IETF Specifications 
Oracle, Mozilla, Isamet, and U. of Washington Participate in Tests 
 
McKinleyville, CA – January 18, 2005 – The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium 
(“CalConnect”), launched December 14, 2004, has kicked off its 2005 schedule of events 
with interoperability testing focused on the CalDAV and iCalendar specifications.  
CalDAV is a standard way of modeling calendar data using WebDAV, an extension to 
the HTTP protocol. WebDAV allows clients to perform remote web content authoring 
operations, that is, a standard way to save data to web sites as opposed to just reading it 
from a site.  iCalendar refers to the Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object 
Specification, a common format for openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling 
information across the Internet. 
 
Isamet, the Mozilla Foundation, and Oracle participated in the first formal 
interoperability testing of CalDAV servers and clients. In addition, Oracle and the 
University of Washington tested importing and exporting iCalendar (RFC 2445) objects 
into the Oracle CalDAV server. 
 
“On schedule, the new Consortium is moving forward with interoperability testing that 
will bring calendaring and scheduling applications into widespread, mainstream use,” 
said Executive Director Dave Thewlis. “During the next three to five years, our members 
will work to eliminate the interoperability glitches that have inhibited the popular 
adoption of those applications.” 
 
In parallel with the Interop tests, Consortium Technical Committees progressed work in 
several areas: develop use cases and requirements for the evolution of calendaring and 
scheduling, establish what features of iCalendar are commonly implemented to determine 
which ones must be in a simplified iCalendar specification, set common testing 
processes, and advance CalDAV and the CalDAV specification in the IETF.   
 
A Roundtable meeting of members followed the testing events and TC meetings. 
Members use Roundtables, which will routinely be held in conjunction with Interops, to 
refine the group’s technical agenda and update objectives.  See www.calconnect.org
 for a 
list of Consortium members. 
 
The Consortium’s next Roundtable and Interop are set for June 1-3, 2005.  The upcoming 
Interop will continue the testing of CalDAV begun during the January 2005 event.  In 
addition, there will be testing of iCalendar standards by vendors who have implemented 
the protocols and want to test their applications with other vendors. 
 
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (www.calconnect.org
) 
 
The Consortium focuses on the interoperable exchange of calendaring and scheduling 
information between dissimilar programs, platforms, and technologies. The mission is to 
provide mechanisms to allow calendaring and scheduling methodologies to interoperate, 
to promote understanding of these methodologies, and to enable calendaring and

scheduling tools and applications to enter the mainstream of computing. The founding 
members are Duke University, EVDB, Isamet, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Meeting 
Maker, M.I.T., The Mozilla Foundation, Novell, Open Source Application Foundation, 
Oracle Corporation, Stanford University, Symbian, UC Berkeley, University of 
Washington, University of Wisconsin Madison, and Yahoo! Inc. Launched December 
2004, the Consortium will hold a series of interoperability testing events, Roundtables 
and Technical Committee meetings to achieve its objectives within a five-year time 
frame.
