*Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium Interop Features IETF
Specifications* _Oracle, Mozilla, Isamet, and U. of Washington
Participate in Tests_

*McKinleyville, CA – January 18, 2005 –* The Calendaring and Scheduling
Consortium (“CalConnect”), launched December 14, 2004, has kicked off
its 2005 schedule of events with interoperability testing focused on the
CalDAV and iCalendar specifications. CalDAV is a standard way of
modeling calendar data using WebDAV, an extension to the HTTP protocol.
WebDAV allows clients to perform remote web content authoring
operations, that is, a standard way to save data to web sites as opposed
to just reading it from a site. iCalendar refers to the Internet
Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification, a common format
for openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information across the
Internet.

Isamet, the Mozilla Foundation, and Oracle participated in the first
formal +
interoperability testing of CalDAV servers and clients. In addition,
Oracle and the University of Washington tested importing and exporting
iCalendar (RFC 2445) objects into the Oracle CalDAV server.

“On schedule, the new Consortium is moving forward with interoperability
testing that will bring calendaring and scheduling applications into
widespread, mainstream use,” said Executive Director Dave Thewlis.
“During the next three to five years, our members will work to eliminate
the interoperability glitches that have inhibited the popular adoption
of those applications.”

In parallel with the Interop tests, Consortium Technical Committees
progressed work in several areas: develop use cases and requirements for
the evolution of calendaring and scheduling, establish what features of
iCalendar are commonly implemented to determine which ones must be in a
simplified iCalendar specification, set common testing +
processes, and advance CalDAV and the CalDAV specification in the IETF.

A Roundtable meeting of members followed the testing events and TC
meetings. Members use Roundtables, which will routinely be held in
conjunction with Interops, to refine the group’s technical agenda and
update objectives. See [.underline]#www.calconnect.org# for a list of
Consortium members.

The Consortium’s next Roundtable and Interop are set for June 1-3, 2005.
The upcoming Interop will continue the testing of CalDAV begun during
the January 2005 event. In addition, there will be testing of iCalendar
standards by vendors who have implemented the protocols and want to test
their applications with other vendors.

*The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium*
([.underline]#www.calconnect.org#)

The Consortium focuses on the interoperable exchange of calendaring and
scheduling information between dissimilar programs, platforms, and
technologies. The mission is to provide mechanisms to allow calendaring
and scheduling methodologies to interoperate, to promote understanding
of these methodologies, and to enable calendaring and

scheduling tools and applications to enter the mainstream of computing.
The founding members are Duke University, EVDB, Isamet, Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, Meeting Maker, M.I.T., The Mozilla Foundation, Novell, Open
Source Application Foundation, Oracle Corporation, Stanford University,
Symbian, UC Berkeley, University of Washington, University of Wisconsin
Madison, and Yahoo! Inc. Launched December 2004, the Consortium will
hold a series of interoperability testing events, Roundtables and
Technical Committee meetings to achieve its objectives within a
five-year time frame.
