_University and Vendor Experts Offer Ways to Avert Problems_

*McKinleyville, CA (PRWeb) February 8, 2007 –* The Calendaring and
Scheduling Consortium (CalConnect) has composed recommendations and
reference links to vendor sites to aid system administrators in handling
the Congressionally mandated change in Daylight Saving Time (DST). A
provision of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 changed DST to begin three
weeks earlier and end one week later, as of the second Sunday in March
2007.

“This modification to the DST rules is the first in 20 years, and it’s
causing headaches for system administrators because the change was
rather abrupt,” noted Dave Thewlis, Executive Director of the
Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium.

CalConnect’s members offer two recommendations: +
--Apply system patches to implement the new extended DST period.

--Consider whether corrections are needed to systems that store
date/time values, such as calendar software or spreadsheets

CalConnect also offers a collection of links to vendor web pages where
DST updates are discussed and patches offered. Visit

“The change in DST rules will remind some of the Y2K problems in
programs that referred to a year using two digits,” explained Joseph
Jackson, Computing Services, Carnegie Mellon University. “The impact of
the DST changes should be smaller, but is still a concern for system
administrators. There may be significant impact on computer support
organizations in cases where meetings in a calendar system need to be
corrected manually.”

_Details of the Recommendations_ +
1. System clock updates

Issue: Systems or devices that include a date/time clock which adjust
automatically for DST use rules to decide when to switch from Standard
to DST.

Recommendation: For computer devices or systems with DST-aware clocks,
apply updates related to the new DST rules. This applies to
workstations, servers, handheld devices, phones, and embedded devices
such as automatic door lock systems.

Impact: Systems that are not updated will have their clocks set one hour
slow during four weeks covered by the extended DST period. Additionally,
e-mail messages may have incorrect time stamps or have their time stamps
incorrectly interpreted.

Systems using older versions of Kerberos authentication may not work, as
they require clocks to be synchronized to within a few minutes. +

Automated Processes that run at a preset time, such as unlocking a door, may happen an
hour later than expected. +

2. Stored date/time values +
Issue: Many computer systems need to represent future dates and times. There may be a
need to correct some of these to accommodate the new DST rules. +
In particular, if the system stores the date and time as a combined value that is relative to
UTC, the data in the system may be off by an hour for the weeks that used to be in
Standard time, but are now in DST. For example, +

____
If a person in the Eastern time zone entered a repeating meeting for 9:00
am Monday, it would be stored as 14:00 UTC for weeks outside of DST
and 13:00 UTC for weeks inside DST.. With the onset of the 2007 DST
rules, the person needs to store the meeting as 13:00 UTC in order to have
it show up as 9:00 am Eastern.
