_University and Vendor Experts Offer Ways to Avert Problems_

*McKinleyville, CA (PRWeb) February 8, 2007 –* The Calendaring and
Scheduling Consortium (CalConnect) has composed recommendations and
reference links to vendor sites to aid system administrators in handling
the Congressionally mandated change in Daylight Saving Time (DST). A
provision of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 changed DST to begin three
weeks earlier and end one week later, as of the second Sunday in March
2007.

“This modification to the DST rules is the first in 20 years, and it’s
causing headaches for system administrators because the change was
rather abrupt,” noted Dave Thewlis, Executive Director of the
Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium.

CalConnect’s members offer two recommendations: +
--Apply system patches to implement the new extended DST period.

--Consider whether corrections are needed to systems that store
date/time values, such as calendar software or spreadsheets

CalConnect also offers a collection of links to vendor web pages where
DST updates are discussed and patches offered. Visit
[.underline]#www.CalConnect.org# to access this information.

“The change in DST rules will remind some of the Y2K problems in
programs that referred to a year using two digits,” explained Joseph
Jackson, Computing Services, Carnegie Mellon University. “The impact of
the DST changes should be smaller, but is still a concern for system
administrators. There may be significant impact on computer support
organizations in cases where meetings in a calendar system need to be
corrected manually.”

_Details of the Recommendations_ +
1. System clock updates

Issue: Systems or devices that include a date/time clock which adjust
automatically for DST use rules to decide when to switch from Standard
to DST.

Recommendation: For computer devices or systems with DST-aware clocks,
apply updates related to the new DST rules. This applies to
workstations, servers, handheld devices, phones, and embedded devices
such as automatic door lock systems.

Impact: Systems that are not updated will have their clocks set one hour
slow during four weeks covered by the extended DST period. Additionally,
e-mail messages may have incorrect time stamps or have their time stamps
incorrectly interpreted.

Systems using older versions of Kerberos authentication may not work, as
they require clocks to be synchronized to within a few minutes.

“This is the most exciting progress we've seen in our 12 years of
involvement defining open Calendaring and Scheduling standards. Having
co-authored the CalDAV specification, Oracle plans to support it as part
of a future release of our collaborative product. The support of this
standard will enable customers to provide their end user communities
with a choice of calendaring interfaces and allows partners to more
easily and cost-effectively develop derivative products and services.”

"CalDAV is a critical part of our interoperability strategy. We support
CalDAV in both our Chandler™ desktop client and our server product. We
are pleased to see steady progress and increasing adoption of CalDAV.
Calendaring adoption is really subject to 'network effects'; with more
adoption, the more valuable the standards become."

Gary Schwartz +

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute +
“RPI’s Bedework, an open-source, standards-compliant, calendaring
server, was designed to be CalDAV capable from its inception. We began
implementing CalDAV support in January 2005, when we first learned of
CalDAV. It was clear to us then, two years ago, that CalDAV would play a
significant role in calendaring interoperability, and with the
publication of the CalDAV RFC, and the increasing number of CalDAV +
implementations, CalDAV is fulfilling this promise.”

*The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (www.calconnect.org)* +
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (CalConnect) is a partnership
among vendors, developers, and customers to advance calendaring and
scheduling standards and implementations. The mission is to provide
mechanisms to allow calendaring and scheduling methodologies to
interoperate, and to promote broad understanding of these methodologies
so that calendaring and scheduling tools and applications can enter the
mainstream of computing. The Consortium develops recommendations for
improvement and extension of relevant standards, develops requirements
and use cases for calendaring and scheduling specifications, conducts
interoperability testing for calendaring and scheduling implementations,
and promotes calendaring and scheduling. Organizational members are
Apple, Boeing, Carnegie Mellon, Dartmouth, Duke University, Eventful,
Fresno State, Google, IBM, Jet Propulsion Lab, Kerio Technologies,
