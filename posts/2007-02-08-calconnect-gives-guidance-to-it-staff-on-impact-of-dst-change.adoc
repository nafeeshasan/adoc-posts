CalConnect Gives Guidance to IT Staff on Impact of DST Change 
University and Vendor Experts Offer Ways to Avert Problems 
 
McKinleyville, CA (PRWeb) February 8, 2007 – The Calendaring and Scheduling 
Consortium (CalConnect) has composed recommendations and reference links to vendor 
sites to aid system administrators in handling the Congressionally mandated change in 
Daylight Saving Time (DST). A provision of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 changed 
DST to begin three weeks earlier and end one week later, as of the second Sunday in 
March 2007.  
 
“This modification to the DST rules is the first in 20 years, and it’s causing headaches for 
system administrators because the change was rather abrupt,” noted Dave Thewlis, 
Executive Director of the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium.  
 
CalConnect’s members offer two recommendations: 
--Apply system patches to implement the new extended DST period. 
--Consider whether corrections are needed to systems that store date/time values, such as 
calendar software or spreadsheets 
 
CalConnect also offers a collection of links to vendor web pages where DST updates are 
discussed and patches offered. Visit www.CalConnect.org
 to access this information. 
 
“The change in DST rules will remind some of the Y2K problems in programs that 
referred to a year using two digits,” explained Joseph Jackson, Computing Services, 
Carnegie Mellon University.  “The impact of the DST changes should be smaller, but is 
still a concern for system administrators. There may be significant impact on computer 
support organizations in cases where meetings in a calendar system need to be corrected 
manually.” 
 
Details of the Recommendations 
1. System clock updates 
 
Issue: Systems or devices that include a date/time clock which adjust automatically for 
DST use rules to decide when to switch from Standard to DST.  
 
Recommendation: For computer devices or systems with DST-aware clocks, apply 
updates related to the new DST rules. This applies to workstations, servers, handheld 
devices, phones, and embedded devices such as automatic door lock systems. 
 
Impact: Systems that are not updated will have their clocks set one hour slow during four 
weeks covered by the extended DST period. Additionally, e-mail messages may have 
incorrect time stamps or have their time stamps incorrectly interpreted. 
 
Systems using older versions of Kerberos authentication may not work, as they require 
clocks to be synchronized to within a few minutes.

Automated Processes that run at a preset time, such as unlocking a door, may happen an 
hour later than expected. 
 
2.  Stored date/time values 
 
Issue: Many computer systems need to represent future dates and times. There may be a 
need to correct some of these to accommodate the new DST rules. 
 
In particular, if the system stores the date and time as a combined value that is relative to 
UTC, the data in the system may be off by an hour for the weeks that used to be in 
Standard time, but are now in DST. For example,  
 
If a person in the Eastern time zone entered a repeating meeting for 9:00 
am Monday, it would be stored as 14:00 UTC for weeks outside of DST 
and 13:00 UTC for weeks inside DST.. With the onset of the 2007 DST 
rules, the person needs to store the meeting as 13:00 UTC in order to have 
it show up as 9:00 am Eastern.  
 
Recommendation: Systems that store date/times relative to the local time zone are not 
likely to be impacted, but products that support multiple time zones will require review. 
For third-party software, contact the vendor. For solutions developed in-house, look for 
date and time values stored as one field in a format relative to UTC. 
 
Impact: Systems that store date/time values relative to UTC will display incorrect times 
within the extended DST period. This will affect events not only in 2007, and  future 
years. 
 
Some calendar systems store day-long events internally as midnight to midnight records. 
These may get shifted by one hour during the new DST weeks, causing the events to 
extend into the day after they were intended to finish. 
 
Other unexpected behavior may occur with calendar systems that synchronize events 
between two or more types of devices, such as a computer and a smart phone.
