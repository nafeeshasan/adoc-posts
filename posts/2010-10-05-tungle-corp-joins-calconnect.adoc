_Membership Expands CalConnect’s Growth in the International Arena_

*– October 5, 2010 –* The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium
(www.calconnect.org) has announced that Tungle Corp. (www.tungle.com) has become one of
the 32 organizations that make up the consortium. CalConnect’s members are universities,
companies, open-source organizations, and government agencies. Tungle is headquartered in
Montreal, Canada.

“Today’s calendar is a static repository of events,” said Marc Gingras,
Founder and CEO of Tungle. “It’s a snapshot, a moment in time. Contrast
that against our dynamic and ever changing lives and we have a
significant disconnect. We believe the time to think about the calendar
of the future is now.”

“CalConnect members strive to create standards and tackle issues of
interoperability among all calendar platformsa topic we very much
believe in,” Gingras continued. “The current state of the calendar
industry represents a tremendous opportunity for innovation. We are
pleased to be members of CalConnect and look forward to collaborating
with such an impressive group of companies and individuals."

CalConnect’s Executive Director Dave Thewlis noted, “As companies and
organizations become

international in scope and spread across more and more time zones, the
work of CalConnect’s members assumes greater economic significance.
CalConnect is finding strong interest in the challenges related to
calendaring and scheduling among both North American and European
organizations. The commonality among all of our members is their support
of and increasing reliance on published protocols and implementation of
open standards in calendaring and scheduling solutions. Our focus is on
interoperability, and open standards are the key.”
