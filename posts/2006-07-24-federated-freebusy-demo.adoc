*July 24, 2006* +
*Federated Freebusy Demo*

Members of the Consortium succssfully demonstrated a proof-of-concept
application which aggregated and displayed Free/Busy information for multiple
individuals across seven different calendaring systems. The demo was conducted
at The Open Group's meeting in Miami on Monday, July 17th in response to The
Open Group's Federated Freebusy Challenge.

The aggregation technnology is based on the Bedework CalDAV implementation, and
the intent of the Consortium is to make the freebusy aggregator, the connectors
to non-CalDAV-based calendaring systems, and the web interface publicly
available as open source.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
The Open Group and The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium Move 
Closer to Solving Free/Busy Problem
SAN FRANCISCO & MCKINLEYVILLE, Calif., July 24, 2006 – During The Open Group’s 
IT Architecture Practitioners Conference held last week at the Hyatt Regency Coral Gables in 
Miami, members of The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (CalConnect) demonstrated a 
proof-of-concept application to aggregate and display free/busy information collected from 
multiple organizations using multiple calendaring applications.
This demonstration was in response to The Open Group Free/Busy Challenge issued in January 
2006 on behalf of The Boeing Company.  The challenge had a very aggressive schedule and was 
based upon specific needs identified by Boeing.  The Open Group and Boeing, which is a 
member of both consortia, invited CalConnect to partner with them in addressing the challenge. 
The proof-of-concept demonstration represents a coordinated effort between The Open Group’s 
Messaging Forum and CalConnect to find ways to identify free/busy status for people from 
different organizations using different calendaring systems as an aid to scheduling joint 
activities, such as meetings and teleconferences. 
The specific objectives of the proof-of-concept project were: 
·a real-time mechanism;
·ability to extract and collate/display free/busy information;
·at least three major calendaring systems;
·open standard protocols; and 
·can be implemented today. 
“Our members identified the need for a simple mechanism to see when a group of people would 
be available for a meeting, whether within or outside of their companies,” said Allen Brown, 
president and CEO, The Open Group. “The members of CalConnect and The Open Group came 
together to meet that challenge.”

CalConnect is working on comprehensive standards-based solutions for calendar and scheduling 
functionality and interoperability, of which exchange of free/busy information is an important 
part.
The objectives of the proof-of-concept project were fully achieved within the specified time 
frame.  The demonstration in Miami included display of free/busy data aggregated across seven 
different calendaring systems, including Bedework, Google Calendar, Lotus Notes, Microsoft 
Exchange, Oracle Calendar, OSAF’s Chandler and TimeBridge.  The core technology used was 
CalDAV, an open standard for calendar access and management.  Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute, the developer of the Bedework Calendar, used its open source CalDAV implementation 
and developed a Free/Busy Aggregator and browser interface.  Boeing and IBM contributed 
connectors to interface CalDAV with Exchange and Notes respectively.  TimeBridge 
demonstrated its scheduling service’s ability to aggregate free/busy information across multiple 
organizations directly within a user’s Microsoft Outlook client.
“CalConnect was very pleased to demonstrate a practical application of the emerging CalDAV 
standard to address a real world problem, and thanks its members, in particular Rensselaer 
Polytechnic, The Boeing Company, IBM and TimeBridge, for their efforts,” said Dave Thewlis, 
the Executive Director of CalConnect.  “The only way that this accomplishment could have been 
met within the timeframe was by building upon open standards-based implementations.”
Based upon CalDAV and other standards, such as iCalendar, the free/busy technology 
demonstrated can readily be enhanced as the standards are evolved to address such issues as 
calendar user discovery, automated scheduling and authentication.
The Open Group and CalConnect members will continue to work together to produce a 
comprehensive report of the achievements to date, encourage the deployment of the solutions 
demonstrated, and plan how to enrich the functionality and applicability of the solutions.

The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (www.calconnect.org)
The Consortium focuses on the interoperable exchange of calendaring and scheduling 
information between dissimilar programs, platforms, and technologies. The mission is to provide 
mechanisms to allow calendaring and scheduling methodologies to interoperate to promote 
understanding of these methodologies, and to enable calendaring and scheduling tools and 
applications to enter the mainstream of computing. Organizational members include Boeing, 
Carnegie Mellon, Dartmouth, Duke University, EVDB, Fresno State, Harvard ASCS, IBM, Jet 
Propulsion Lab, MIT, Mozilla Foundation, New York University,  Novell, Open Source 
Applications Foundation, Oracle Corporation, PeopleCube, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,
