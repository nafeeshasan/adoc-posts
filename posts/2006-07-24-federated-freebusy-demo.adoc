*Federated Freebusy Demo*

Members of the Consortium succssfully demonstrated a proof-of-concept
application which aggregated and displayed Free/Busy information for multiple
individuals across seven different calendaring systems. The demo was conducted
at The Open Group's meeting in Miami on Monday, July 17th in response to The
Open Group's Federated Freebusy Challenge.

The aggregation technnology is based on the Bedework CalDAV implementation, and
the intent of the Consortium is to make the freebusy aggregator, the connectors
to non-CalDAV-based calendaring systems, and the web interface publicly
available as open source.
