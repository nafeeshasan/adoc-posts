*CalConnect Testing Event Largest Ever; Mobile Interop Tests Set
Precedent*

*McKinleyville, CA – February 19, 2008 –* The Calendaring and Scheduling
Consortium opened a week of meetings with a CalConnect Interoperability
Test Event (C.I.T.E.) on February 3-4 that involved 10 organizations
testing their calendaring and scheduling technology and a total of 30
representatives including four observers) It was the largest C.I.T.E.
that the group has staged in its four-year history. As part of the
C.I.T.E., CalConnect also hosted its first Mobile Calendaring
Interoperability Test Event, a series of interoperability tests focused
on mobile calendaring data exchange.

“There are significant problems in mobile calendaring today,” said Dave
Thewlis, CalConnect’s Executive Director. “The synchronization protocols
used to “sync” mobile device calendars are not sensitive to the validity
of the data, only that the bits were transmitted successfully. As a
result, regular synchronization testing cannot detect whether the data
transferred is actually valid. Our Mobile Calendar Interoperability Test
Suite was developed to allow tests of the real calendar data.”

Thewlis also noted that mobile devices have limited capabilities, so
calendar data is often transformed to send to or from mobile devices,
resulting in interoperability challenges, In addition, in the mobile
world, data must exchange between a range of device

manufacturers, mobile operators, and calendaring systems. “To further
complicate the issue, most mobile devices use the obsolete “vcalendar”
standard instead of the current icalendar standard, which means they
cannot reliably support the same functions as desktop calendar systems.”

Organizations participating in the C.I.T.E. events were Apple, Kerio
Technologies, Marware, Microsoft, Oracle, Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, Scalix (a Xandros company), Sony Ericsson, Sun Microsystems,
and Zimbra (a Yahoo! company).

*The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (www.calconnect.org)* +
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (CalConnect) is a partnership
among vendors, developers, and customers to advance calendaring and
scheduling standards and implementations. The mission is to provide
mechanisms to allow calendaring and scheduling methodologies to
interoperate, and to promote broad understanding of these methodologies
so that calendaring and scheduling tools and applications can enter the
mainstream of computing. The Consortium develops recommendations for
improvement and extension of relevant standards, develops requirements
and use cases for calendaring and scheduling specifications, conducts
interoperability testing for calendaring and scheduling implementations,
and promotes calendaring and scheduling. Organizational members are
Apple, Boeing, Carnegie Mellon, Dartmouth, Duke University, Eventful,
Fresno State, Google, IBM, Kerio Technologies, MailSite, Marware,
Microsoft, +
Mirapoint, MIT, Mozilla Foundation, New York University, Open Connector
Groupware, Open Source Applications Foundation, Oracle, PeopleCube,
Princeton University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Scalix, Sony
Ericsson, Stanford University, Stockholm University, Sun Microsystems,
Symbian, Synchronica, TimeBridge, Trumba, UC

Berkeley, University of Chicago, University of Michigan, University of
Pennsylvania, University of Washington, University of Wisconsin, Yahoo!
