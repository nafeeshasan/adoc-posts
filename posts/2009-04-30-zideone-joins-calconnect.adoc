*ZideOne Joins US-Based Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium*

_Membership Expands CalConnect’s Growth in the International Arena_

*McKinleyville, CA – April 29, 2009 –* The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium
(www.calconnect.org) has announced that ZideOne (www.zideone.com) has become one of the
13 universities, 23 companies, and 2 open-source organizations that make up the consortium.
ZideOne is headquartered in Magdeburg, Germany.

ZideOne participated in CalConnect’s “Meet CalConnect” event in Prague,
Czech Republic.

“Standards are crucial to bring calendaring to a new level,” said Helge
Hess, CEO of ZideOne, “and ZideOne believes that CalConnect is the
organization to drive calendaring standards. E-mail messaging grew by
magnitudes when Internet standards got implemented; we target the same
thing for calendaring.”

“As companies and organizations become international in scope and spread
across more and more time zones, the work of CalConnect’s members
assumes greater economic significance,”

said the Consortium’s Executive Director Dave Thewlis. “CalConnect is
finding strong interest in the challenges related to calendaring and
scheduling among both North American and European organizations. The
commonality among all of our members is their support of and increasing
reliance on published protocols and implementation of open standards in
calendaring and scheduling solutions. Our focus is on interoperability,
and open standards are the key.”
