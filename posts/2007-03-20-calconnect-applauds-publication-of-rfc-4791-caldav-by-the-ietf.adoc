*March 20, 2007* +
*CalConnect applauds publication of RFC 4791, CalDAV, by the IETF*: The
IETF has published http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4791.txt,
Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV). The Consortium has issued a
press release concerning the significance of CalDAV and its relationship
to the Consortium at
link:{{'/docs/press-releases/070320calconnectcaldavrelease.pdf' | relative_url }}[CalConnect CalDAV Release].

*CalConnect Applauds Publication of IETF CalDAV Proposed Standard*

*McKinleyville, CA – March 20, 2007* – “CalDAV is the first full open
standard protocol for calendaring and scheduling client/server systems,”
said Dave Thewlis, Executive Director of the Calendaring and Scheduling
Consortium (CalConnect) in response to the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) publication of the _Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV
(CalDAV)_ as a Proposed Standard. “It provides the basis for true open +
calendaring between individuals and organizations.” +
IETF published RFC 4791 on March 16, 2007; IETF Proposed Standards are
called RFCs (Requests for Comments).

CalConnect has determined that CalDAV will offer a significant new
benefit to implementers and customers of calendaring systems. CalConnect
has led the way in CalDAV interoperability testing with several of its
members actively developing their own CalDAV products, as well as
providing input into the development of the specification itself.

“Calendaring and scheduling systems are starting to be built around
CalDAV servers and clients, both desktop and browser-based, offering a
low-cost, interoperable calendaring and scheduling facility to any ISP
or business,” Thewlis continued. “So in our efforts to promote
interoperable calendaring, the publication of this standard by the IETF
is a watershed event.” +
CalConnect asserts that CalDAV will be important for several key
reasons. First and foremost, it is an open standard built upon much of
the preceding work in +
calendaring and scheduling standards. CalDAV implementations have been
built as the standard itself developed and these efforts have helped to
refine it. In addition, vendors are building calendaring solutions based
on CalDAV into products other than mainstream calendar applications,
such as project management tools. This all bodes well for wide adoption
of this standard within the industry.

“In the future CalConnect will continue to host regular CalDAV
interoperability events along with its usual calendar interoperability
testing, and will continue to promote and develop the standard and use
of it, in important areas such as mobile devices,” Thewlis noted.

_CalDAV at Work_ +
A number of CalConnect members have advanced the implementation of
CalDAV in their work, specifically, Apple, Marware, Mozilla Foundation,
Open Source Applications Foundation, Oracle, and Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute.

Maria Martin +
Chief Operating Officer +
Marware +
“Marware is a proud supporter of the CalConnect consortium, and their
work on +
CalDAV. We have integrated CalDAV support into an upcoming release of
our Project X project management application for Mac OS X.”

Don Deutsch +
Vice President Standards Strategy and Architecture +
Oracle +

“This is the most exciting progress we've seen in our 12 years of involvement defining
open Calendaring and Scheduling standards. Having co-authored the CalDAV
specification, Oracle plans to support it as part of a future release of our collaborative
product. The support of this standard will enable customers to provide their end user
communities with a choice of calendaring interfaces and allows partners to more easily
and cost-effectively develop derivative products and services.” +

Katie Parlante +
VP, Engineering +
OSAF  +
"CalDAV is a critical part of our interoperability strategy. We support CalDAV in both
our Chandler™ desktop client and our server product. We are pleased to see steady
progress and increasing adoption of CalDAV. Calendaring adoption is really subject to
'network effects'; with more adoption, the more valuable the standards become." +

Gary Schwartz +
Director Communications & Middleware Technologies +
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute +
“RPI’s Bedework, an open-source, standards-compliant, calendaring server, was designed
to be CalDAV capable from its inception. We began implementing CalDAV support in
January 2005, when we first learned of CalDAV. It was clear to us then, two years ago,
that CalDAV would play a significant role in calendaring interoperability, and with the
publication of the CalDAV RFC, and the increasing number of CalDAV
implementations, CalDAV is fulfilling this promise.”  +

*The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (www.calconnect.org)* +
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (CalConnect) is a partnership among
vendors, developers, and customers to advance calendaring and scheduling standards and
implementations. The mission is to provide mechanisms to allow calendaring and
scheduling methodologies to interoperate, and to promote broad understanding of these
methodologies so that calendaring and scheduling tools and applications can enter the
mainstream of computing. The Consortium develops recommendations for improvement
and extension of relevant standards, develops requirements and use cases for calendaring
and scheduling specifications, conducts interoperability testing for calendaring and
scheduling implementations, and promotes calendaring and scheduling. Organizational
members are Apple, Boeing, Carnegie Mellon, Dartmouth, Duke University, Eventful,
Fresno State, Google, IBM, Jet Propulsion Lab, Kerio Technologies, Marware, MIT,
Mozilla Foundation, New York University, Novell, Open Source Applications
Foundation, Oracle Corporation, PeopleCube, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Rockliffe,
Stanford University, Symbian, Synchronica, TimeBridge, Trumba, UC Berkeley,
University of Chicago, University of Washington, University of Wisconsin, Yahoo! Inc.
