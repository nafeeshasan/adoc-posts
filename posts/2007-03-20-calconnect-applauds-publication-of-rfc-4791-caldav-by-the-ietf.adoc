*CalConnect applauds publication of RFC 4791, CalDAV, by the IETF*: The
IETF has published http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4791.txt,
Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV). The Consortium has issued a

*CalConnect Applauds Publication of IETF CalDAV Proposed Standard*

*McKinleyville, CA – March 20, 2007* – “CalDAV is the first full open
standard protocol for calendaring and scheduling client/server systems,”
said Dave Thewlis, Executive Director of the Calendaring and Scheduling
Consortium (CalConnect) in response to the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) publication of the _Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV
(CalDAV)_ as a Proposed Standard. “It provides the basis for true open +
calendaring between individuals and organizations.” +
IETF published RFC 4791 on March 16, 2007; IETF Proposed Standards are
called RFCs (Requests for Comments).

CalConnect has determined that CalDAV will offer a significant new
benefit to implementers and customers of calendaring systems. CalConnect
has led the way in CalDAV interoperability testing with several of its
members actively developing their own CalDAV products, as well as
providing input into the development of the specification itself.

“Calendaring and scheduling systems are starting to be built around
CalDAV servers and clients, both desktop and browser-based, offering a
low-cost, interoperable calendaring and scheduling facility to any ISP
or business,” Thewlis continued. “So in our efforts to promote
interoperable calendaring, the publication of this standard by the IETF
is a watershed event.” +
CalConnect asserts that CalDAV will be important for several key
reasons. First and foremost, it is an open standard built upon much of
the preceding work in +
calendaring and scheduling standards. CalDAV implementations have been
built as the standard itself developed and these efforts have helped to
refine it. In addition, vendors are building calendaring solutions based
on CalDAV into products other than mainstream calendar applications,
such as project management tools. This all bodes well for wide adoption
of this standard within the industry.

“In the future CalConnect will continue to host regular CalDAV
interoperability events along with its usual calendar interoperability
testing, and will continue to promote and develop the standard and use
of it, in important areas such as mobile devices,” Thewlis noted.

_CalDAV at Work_ +
A number of CalConnect members have advanced the implementation of
CalDAV in their work, specifically, Apple, Marware, Mozilla Foundation,
Open Source Applications Foundation, Oracle, and Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute.

Maria Martin +
Chief Operating Officer +
Marware +
“Marware is a proud supporter of the CalConnect consortium, and their
work on +
CalDAV. We have integrated CalDAV support into an upcoming release of
our Project X project management application for Mac OS X.”
