*Top Vendors, Users Launch Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium* _Goal:
End the Problem of Incompatible Calendaring and Scheduling Products_

*McKinleyville, CA – December 14, 2004 –* Seven vendors, six
universities, two open source foundations, and a research
facilityembership of the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (), which
named David C.

Thewlis the first Executive Director. The on the interoperable exchange
of calendaring and scheduling information between dissimilar programs,
platforms, and technologies. The founding members are (in alphabetical
order) Duke University, EVDB, Isamet, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Meeting
Maker, M.I.T., The Mozilla Foundation, Novell, Open Source Application
Foundation, Oracle Corporation, Stanford University, Symbian, UC
Berkeley, University of Washington, University of Wisconsin Madison, and
Yahoo! Inc.

“Our members’ intent is to enable calendaring and scheduling tools and
applications to enter the mainstream of computing,” said Dave Thewlis.
“After email, the World Wide Web, and instant messaging, calendaring and
scheduling capabilities are what business people and consumers will
really care about.”

“This isn’t simply about calendar programs,” noted Patricia Egen,
Interop manager and member of the Board of Directors, who originated the
idea of the Consortium. “This is about seamlessly connecting your
calendar with others so that your professional and personal life runs
more smoothly.”

The Consortium, planned to have a three- to five-year lifespan in which
to achieve its objectives, builds on work already accomplished or in
progress within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Currently,
large consumers such as universities and corporations face costly
problems coordinating resources because departmental calendaring and
scheduling applications may not be based on open standards that allow
interoperability. Even standards-based systems from different vendors
may not work together. With sets of IETF specifications as the heart of
a solution, the Consortium provides a forum for vendors to mitigate
conflicts between their competing products.

The Consortium has a schedule of activities that give the relevant
standards commercial value, that is, promotion, requirements setting,
and validation. Events on the agenda include +

• Three to four interoperability testing events (“Interops”) a year, with
the next one scheduled for January 11-12 in Seattle, WA. +

• Roundtables and Technical Committee meetings of the Consortium; the next
is scheduled for 11-13 January in Seattle, WA, co-located with the
Interop event. +

• Ongoing Technical Committee work, intended to provide feedback or
information to IETF standards activities +

• Presentations at related conferences +
Non-members are welcome to participate in the Interops, but Roundtables
and Technical Committees are for members only.

_Quotes from Members of the Steering Committee_

Duke University (www.duke.edu) +
“The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium appears to be re-invigorating
the +
development of calendaring standards that became stalled for a few
years,” Michael Gettes, senior IT architect at Duke University, said.
“We now have customer involvement along with all the important calendar
standards leaders and vendors to ensure we develop interoperable
solutions as quickly as possible. It is an exciting time for the
calendaring industry.”

The Mozilla Foundation (www.mozilla.org) +
“The launch of the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium represents a
promising step forward in the development of critical calendaring
standards,” said Mike Shaver of the Mozilla Foundation. “The Mozilla
Foundation is excited to participate in the +
Consortium's efforts to link users, vendors and protocol architects in
pursuit of +
universally interoperable calendaring.”

Open Source Application Foundation (www.osafoundation.org) +
“OSAF is pleased to be able to support the development of
interoperable +
calendaring solutions by becoming a founding member of the Calendaring +
and Scheduling Consortium,” said Lisa Dusseault, Development manager,
standards architect, OSAF. “The Consortium plays an important role in
enabling the dialog between partners that is essential for the
establishment of open and interoperable standards.”

The University of Washington (www.cac.washington.edu) +
“For years there has been a large need within higher education for
interoperable standards-based calendaring,” noted Oren Sreebny;
Director, Client Services +
and Learning Technologies; Computing & Communications; University of +
Washington. “This need is growing with the proliferation of online
scheduling and pervasive portable devices. The ability for an
organization like CalConnect to provide a neutral forum to encourage all
interested parties to collaborate on solving these sets of issues and to
demonstrate the usefulness of interoperation is critical for moving this
mission forward. We are proud to be part of the founding of this
organization, and look forward to working with the members to advance
the state of the art in calendaring and scheduling.”

The University of Wisconsin (www.doit.wisc.edu) +
“The University of Wisconsin-Madison became a founding member of the
Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium to help our campus customers,”
explained Bill Scheuerell Director of Enterprise Internet Services,
Division of Information Technology, +
University of Wisconsin-Madison Campus. “Departments rely on integrated
calendaring to organize university schedules. The consortium will help
all of us set interoperability standards and system features, and
communicate them to potential vendors.”
