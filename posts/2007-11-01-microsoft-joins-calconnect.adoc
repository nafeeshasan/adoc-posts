*Microsoft Joins CalConnect to Focus on Global Time-Zone Solution*

*McKinleyville, CA – November 1, 2007 –* The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium(www.CalConnect.org) has announced that Microsoft Corporation (www.microsoft.com) has joined CalConnect. Through the non-profit consortium, Microsoft is collaborating
with universities, research facilities, and other technology companies to define a formal
time zone registry and online time zone service similar to the Network Time Protocol.

CalConnect’s work in the area of time zones has involved both public
education and assistance towards resolution of technical problems
related to government-mandated time-zone shifts. By creating a global
time zone service, software programs on PCs, mobile phones, and other
electronic devices could update automatically with the latest time zone
changes.

“What could be more frustrating than missing a meeting next Monday
morning because your computer or mobile phone calendar hasn’t
automatically adjusted to the time change? Time zone resolution is a
great example of how we as an industry must improve in providing users
the kind of ‘just works’ experiences they expect,” said Ray Ozzie, chief
software architect, Microsoft Corp. “We look forward to contributing to
this consortium and working together to eliminate this annoyance for our
customers.”

“We expect Microsoft to be a significant contributor to CalConnect, and
in particular the Timezone Registry and Timezone Service Protocol—things
that truly require a +
collaborative effort and cannot be done by a single vendor,” noted Dave
Thewlis, Executive Director of CalConnect. “The commonality among all of
our member companies is their support of and increasing reliance on
published protocols and implementation of open standards in calendaring
and scheduling solutions. Our focus is on interoperability, and open
standards are the key.”

With this announcement, CalConnect’s membership now stands at 39
organizations.

CalConnect membership is open to vendors, open source organizations,
academic institutions, customers, standards-setting organizations, and
consulting organizations.
