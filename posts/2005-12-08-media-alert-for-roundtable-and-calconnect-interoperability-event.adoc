Item: Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium’s Fifth Interop and
Roundtable

News: CalConnect is now accepting registrations for its fifth Interop
(see below) and +
Roundtable. Status of Technical Committees and their action plans will
be the focal point of the Roundtable, open to members and observers.

This event reflects the Consortium’s ability to stay on target to
produce interoperable calendaring and scheduling solutions within five
years of inception.

The Interop, open to members and non-members, will comprise multiple
scenarios including CalDAV server and client testing, Min-IOP testing,
and iCAL, iTIP, iMIP interoperability testing. Interop test events are
open to members and non-members. They involve developers of Calendaring
and Scheduling products or implementations that are based upon
Calendaring and Scheduling standards and open specifications, in
particular the IETF iCal, iMIP and iTIP RFCs and related drafts. At the
events, implementers test their implementations for accuracy in
implementing the Calendaring and Scheduling Standards, and test
interoperability with other implementations. Goals of the Interops
include assessing the C&S standards, assessing the implementations, and
determining interoperability.

The Roundtable will be comprised of Technical Committee meetings, to
which all members and observers are welcome, plus some additional
sessions and committee meetings. Thursday morning will be the full
Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This
session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees,
demonstrations resulting from the Interop testing earlier in the week,
and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

Selected Technical Committees of CalConnect and summaries of their focus
