IceWarp participated in CalConnect’s second Mobile Calendaring
Interoperability Test Event on November 4-6 in the Czech Republic and
plans to be active in CalConnect’s Technical +
Committees for Mobile, CalDAV and iSchedule.

“Having participated in a few CalConnect events, we were able to
progress on the planned features of our upcoming product version faster
and with confidence of compatibility,” said Jakub Klos, the founder of
IceWarp. “We have learned that CalConnect is unique in bringing vendors
together on a broad range of standards-related issues in the arena of
calendaring, scheduling, and synchronization. Its methodology is also
extremely effective in deploying the outcomes of committees and test
events into recognized standards. By closing the loop between vendors,
the end user will profit; we are happy to interact with others who share
the same priority within CalConnect."

“As companies and organizations become international in scope and spread
across more and more time zones, the work of CalConnect’s members
assumes greater economic significance,” said the Consortium’s Executive
Director Dave Thewlis. “CalConnect is finding strong interest in the
challenges related to calendaring and scheduling among both North
American and European organizations. The commonality among all of our
members is their support of and increasing reliance on published
protocols and implementation of open standards in calendaring and
scheduling solutions. Our focus is on interoperability, and open
standards are the key.”
