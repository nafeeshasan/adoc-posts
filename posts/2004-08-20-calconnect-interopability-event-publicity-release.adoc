Industry Leaders Score at Calendaring and Scheduling Interop 
 
IBM, Oracle Demonstrate Conformance with Key Parts of IETF Specification; 
Interoperability Testing Highlights Need for Well-Focused Consortium 
 
Berkeley, CA – August 20, 2004 – On July 29-30, the University of California at Berkeley hosted 
the first calendaring consortium-sponsored testing event on the interoperable exchange of 
calendaring and scheduling information between dissimilar programs, platforms, and 
technologies. 
 
“UC Berkeley has long depended on and fostered the use and development of standards,” noted 
Jeffrey McCullough, Principal Programmer, University of California, Berkeley. “Hosting this event 
was a great opportunity to further enhance interoperability in calendaring by providing forward 
thinking, standards compliant vendors a place to come together and test their products.” 
 
The technical goal of the Interop was to test a set of specifications developed by the Internet 
Engineering Task Force (IETF), specifically RFC 2445-6 and 7: iCalendar, iTIP and iMIP. 
Organizers produced the event to move the RFCs forward toward standards status as well as to 
ascertain the need for an industry/customer consortium on calendaring and scheduling. 
 
Dr. Nathaniel S. Borenstein, Distinguished Engineer, IBM Lotus Division, said, “IBM's Lotus 
Software helped lead the definition of the original iCal standards, and has supported them in our 
products since their publication in 1998. The standards represented an important step forward, 
but since then, the implementor community has learned a great deal about calendar 
interoperation.” 
 
Regarding the Interop, Dr. Borenstein added, “IBM's Lotus Software enthusiastically supports the 
efforts of the emerging Calendaring & Scheduling Consortium to revitalize the standards process 
and iron out the wrinkles that have kept Internet calendaring from reaching its full potential.  We 
view this Interop as another step in the long march towards fully interoperable calendar systems, 
and look forward to further cooperation and progress.” 
 
“Oracle is delighted to have contributed to this interoperability testing event for the benefit of our 
customers and the global calendaring and scheduling community,” said Marten den Haring, 
Director of Product Management, Oracle Collaboration Suite Calendar. “We support the 
development and promotion of emerging open standards as well as the efforts of a number of 
standards bodies, including the IETF.  These efforts help build momentum for the adoption of an 
open protocol to access and manage calendaring information.”
