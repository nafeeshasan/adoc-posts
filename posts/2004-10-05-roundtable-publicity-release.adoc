*Top Vendors, Users Act to End Problem of Incompatible Calendaring and
Scheduling Products*

*McKinleyville, CA – October 5, 2004 –* On September 23-24, industry
leaders and major academic customers of calendaring and scheduling
products focused on the path to +
interoperability in a second event sponsored by the emerging Calendaring
and Scheduling Consortium. Hosted by Oracle Corporation in Montreal, “A
Roundtable Discussion on the Future of Interoperable Calendaring and
Scheduling” participants included Duke University, IBM Lotus Software,
Isamet, The Mozilla Foundation, Novell, Oracle, the Open Source
Applications Foundation, Stata Labs, the University of California at
Berkeley, the University of Washington, and Yahoo. It was a follow-up to
a Consortium-sponsored testing event at the University of California,
Berkeley on July 29-30.

“A lack of interoperable calendaring and scheduling products is a major
productivity barrier,” said Dave Thewlis, executive director of the
Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium. “It can lead to serious
miscommunications, failed activities, and a huge waste of time.”

By involving both the vendors and the user community, participants
intended the Roundtable to contribute to measurable progress toward
achieving interoperable calendaring and scheduling. Products of the
Roundtable include statements of common vision and shared goals, a
charter for the Consortium, and the kernel of an action plan.

"A primary goal of the consortium is to further the design and
implementation of calendaring and scheduling standards,” said Marten den
Haring, director, Product Management, Oracle +
Collaboration Suite Calendar. “The Roundtable's outcome is the blueprint
for the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium, and Oracle is proud to be
one of the organizations involved with this effort, which will create
initiatives that benefit collaboration.”

Discussions at the event covered topics such as the applicability of
existing forums; co-existence and harmonization with the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF), customer and user involvement with use
cases, requirements setting and directions; and interoperability testing
and conformance.
