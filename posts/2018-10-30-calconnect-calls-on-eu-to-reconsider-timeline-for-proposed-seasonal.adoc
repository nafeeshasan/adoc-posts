CalConnect calls on EU to reconsider timeline for proposed 
seasonal time changes 
Workshop and mailing list announced for discussion of technical impact 
Summary 
The European Commission has proposed, after public consultation, that its member states 
discontinue seasonal changes of time, effective October 2019. The member states must decide 
how to implement the proposed change before April 1st 2019. Several governments and 
organizations have since expressed concerns on such a tight timeline for the far-reaching 
change. 
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium​ (CalConnect) a global non-profit organization 
shares these concerns, and recommends the European Commission extend the timelines 
specified in the proposal. 
Specifically, we recommend providing a transition period of at least one year (12 months) after 
the final decision of the change has been set. CalConnect will host a public workshop on the 
proposed EU changes at its next conference in early February 2019, and has recently launched 
a public mailing list for the discussion of best practices for planning new time zone changes. 
 
The European Commission’s Proposal 
The European Commission has proposed requiring European Union (EU) member states to 
decide whether to permanently keep summer or winter time by 1 April 2019. (​ Proposal for 
discontinuing seasonal changes of time and repealing Directive​ ​ 2000/84/EC​ ).​ For countries 
opting for permanent winter time, the last daylight-saving time change will occur in October 
2019. 
This proposal was made in response to the corresponding public consultation that ended in 
August 2018, where the majority of participating EU citizens voted to abandon daylight saving 
time in the EU.

Specifically, the timeline specified in this proposal only gives EU member states 6 months of 
lead time from the decision date of March 2019 (since the adoption date is set to 1 April 2019) 
to the effective date of October 2019. 
 
Our concerns 
CalConnect is concerned insufficient notice has been provided to EU member states to 
make their decisions and implement changes. CalConnect is deeply aware of potential 
repercussions of such a change with short notice. Our membership is comprised of 
technology vendors and end-user organizations focused on the areas of date and time, 
calendaring, scheduling, and for more than a decade, time zone issues. 
CalConnect’s experience from similar DST changes in the past indicates that such changes 
pose serious risks to the accuracy of stored time-related data and schedules (such as 
meetings, appointments, flights and transit schedules). 
Users of services and products that depend on correct time zone information -- universities, 
companies of all sizes, and many other types of organizations, as well as their suppliers -- 
will face a major challenge to assess which software and hardware is vulnerable, and to 
implement mitigation measures. 
While customers need adequate time for budgeting, procurement, and installation of 
upgrades or replacements for this change, vendors also need time to implement and test 
product changes, all the while under pressure to meet market needs and fulfill regulatory 
compliance. An extended timeline will benefit all parties. 
 
Change management 
Serious technical and operational problems can occur when insufficient time is allowed for time 
zone changes. 
Over the last decade, a number of time zone related changes performed were enforced in 
diverse areas without consideration of best practices and adequate planning, leaving user

organizations, especially small and medium businesses, scrambling and suffering from the 
effects of using incorrect time zone information. 
We strongly suggest extending the effective implementation date of October 2019 to March 
2020, allowing a transition period of at one year from the decision deadline of March 2019. This 
would provide consumer and technology vendors alike ample time to implement the necessary 
changes.  
  
What CalConnect is doing to help the transition 
CalConnect is pursuing a number of initiatives in order to assist policy makers and IT specialists 
in implementing the proposed time zone changes. 
Public workshop 
CalConnect is organizing a public workshop on the EU proposal to abandon seasonal time 
change at our next conference in Zurich, Switzerland (Feb 4-8, 2019). 
We call on all stakeholders (e.g., vendors, consumers, policymakers) interested in, or affected 
by this Directive, to​ ​register​ and participate in the workshop. 
Time zone distribution standard 
Our members have created the standard for​ ​Time zone Data Distribution Services​ (IETF RFC 
7808). Today, most services and devices still rely on patching and manually updating time zone 
information instead of automated or dynamic updates. 
We recommend the European Commission strongly support adoption of relevant open 
standards, and encourage its member states to collaborate with each other as well as the 
international standards bodies. 
Coordinated global effort with ISO/TC 154 
We are working closely with other standards-setting organizations (including ISO/TC 154 and 
UNECE) to harmonize time zone data and time zone distribution internationally. 
We recommend regional standards bodies in the European Union, such as​ ​CEN​ and 
CENELECT​,​ and standards bodies in its member states  participate in this global partnership.
