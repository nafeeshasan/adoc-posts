*CalConnect Holds Second Mobile Calendaring and Scheduling
Interoperability Testing*

*_Kerio Technologies Hosted Test Event in Czech Republic_*

*November 24, 2008 -* The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium ((www.calconnect.org) held
its second Mobile Calendaring Interoperability Test Event (C.I.T.E.) 08
at Kerio Technologies offices in the Czech Republic. Icewarp, Kerio,
Oracle, Symbian, and Synthesis participated, indicating the growing role
of European companies in CalConnect’s technical work in the mobile area.

Tests involved calendar interoperability among three clients and four
servers. Specifically, C.I.T.E. participants tested calendar data
synchronization between a mobile device and a server using OMA DS (aka
SyncML) and Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync® protocols. The test cases
were selected from CalConnect's Mobile Calendar Interoperability Test
Suite and run in combinations of client and server implementations from
different vendors.

Dave Thewlis, CalConnect’s Executive Director, noted, “The testing went
well and, as expected, uncovered a number of difficulties with
interoperability, and some underlying problems below the calendar data
level as well. All of the participants felt that it was very worthwhile
and advanced the interoperability of their products. All participants
indicated they wished to engage in future mobile interoperability test
events if possible.”

Pat Egen, Patricia Egen Consulting, who designs and oversees the testing
events, explained, “The biggest challenge is most mobile devices use an
older version of the calendaring specification. A major objective of
CalConnect is to help influence movement, by the device developers and
the mobile operators, towards the newer, richer specification.

Following the Mobile Interoperability Test Event, CalConnect hosted an
invitational Meet CalConnect event in Prague, Czech Republic, on Friday
November 7, and repeated in London on November 10. Representatives of
five members of CalConnect participated in the events involving
potential members.

*The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (www.calconnect.org)*

The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (CalConnect) is a partnership
among vendors, developers, and customers to advance calendaring and
scheduling standards and +
implementations. The mission is to provide mechanisms to allow
calendaring and scheduling methodologies to interoperate, and to promote
broad understanding of these methodologies so that calendaring and
scheduling tools and applications can enter the mainstream of computing.

The Consortium develops recommendations for improvement and extension of
relevant standards, develops requirements and use cases for calendaring
and scheduling specifications,

conducts interoperability testing for calendaring and scheduling
implementations, and promotes calendaring and scheduling. Organizational
members are Apple, Cabo Communications, Carnegie Mellon, Dartmouth, Duke
University, Eventful, Fresno State, Google, IBM, Kerio Technologies,
