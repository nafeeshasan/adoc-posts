CalConnect Will Hold its First European Interoperability Test Event and Conference in Prague   CalConnect XXII Focuses on Advancing Calendaring and Scheduling Standards for More Effective Business Communication  August 18, 2011 – McKinleyville, Calif. – CalConnect (The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium; www.CalConnect.org) will hold its first European conference in Prague, Czech Republic, on October 3-7, 2011. The consortium is a partnership among leading technology organizations and universities to promote open standards and the interoperability of calendaring systems to give users more choices when it comes to devices and calendaring applications.   CalConnect XXII will feature interoperability testing events, symposia, meetings, and roundtable discussions. The event will be hosted by Kerio Technologies, a founding CalConnect member. The event is open to any organization or software developer with a stake in improving the effectiveness of calendaring and sharing.  “Global companies with a significant European presence are among CalConnect’s founding members,” said Executive Director Dave Thewlis, executive director, CalConnect. “As standards and interoperability are central to CalConnect’s mission, and are strong core values of global information technology, we have long recognized the importance of increasing European involvement in CalConnect. We are looking forward to a lively event in Prague.”    CalConnect has previously held special events in Europe in 2007 and 2008.  The first 2.5 days feature an Interoperability test event, where vendors will get hands-on lab testing and peer review of their calendaring offerings. The final 2.5 days will focus on discussions that shape the future of upcoming new standards including xCal, CalDAV and CardDAV.  Interoperability Testing Event  CalConnect’s interoperability test events offer those with calendaring implementations the opportunity to test compatibility with others and gather immediate feedback. Events are structured to allow “testing pairs” in which each participant gets a chance to test with everyone in the course of the 2.5 days.  Areas of expected testing in Prague include: • iCalendar/iMIP/iTIP testing • CalDAV, including implicit scheduling • CardDAV • CalDAV/CardDAV SRV discovery and well-known URI • Freebusy Read URL protocol • The new Timezone Service Protocol • xCal, the XML format for iCalendar • CalWS, the Web Services protocol for calendaring • Mobile CalDAV client/server testing • Synchronization testing for mobile clients in general
