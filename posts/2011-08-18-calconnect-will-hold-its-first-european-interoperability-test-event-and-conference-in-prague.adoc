*CalConnect Will Hold its First European Interoperability Test Event and
Conference in Prague*

_CalConnect XXII Focuses on Advancing Calendaring and Scheduling
Standards for More Effective Business Communication_

*August 18, 2011 – McKinleyville, Calif. –* CalConnect (The Calendaring and Scheduling
Consortium; www.CalConnect.org) will hold its first European conference in Prague, Czech
Republic, on October 3-7, 2011. The consortium is a partnership among leading technology
organizations and universities to promote open standards and the interoperability of calendaring
systems to give users more choices when it comes to devices and calendaring applications.

CalConnect XXII will feature interoperability testing events, symposia,
meetings, and +
roundtable discussions. The event will be hosted by Kerio Technologies,
a founding CalConnect member. The event is open to any organization or
software developer with a stake in improving the effectiveness of
calendaring and sharing.

“Global companies with a significant European presence are among
CalConnect’s founding members,” said Executive Director Dave Thewlis,
executive director, CalConnect. “As standards and interoperability are
central to CalConnect’s mission, and are strong core values of global
information technology, we have long recognized the importance of
increasing European involvement in CalConnect. We are looking forward to
a lively event in Prague.”

CalConnect has previously held special events in Europe in 2007 and
2008.

The first 2.5 days feature an Interoperability test event, where vendors
will get hands-on lab testing and peer review of their calendaring
offerings. The final 2.5 days will focus on discussions that shape the
future of upcoming new standards including xCal, CalDAV and CardDAV.

*_Interoperability Testing Event_*

CalConnect’s interoperability test events offer those with calendaring
implementations the opportunity to test compatibility with others and
gather immediate feedback. Events are structured to allow “testing
pairs” in which each participant gets a chance to test with everyone in
the course of the 2.5 days. Areas of expected testing in Prague
include: +
•iCalendar/iMIP/iTIP testing +
•CalDAV, including implicit scheduling +
•CardDAV +
•CalDAV/CardDAV SRV discovery and well-known URI +
•Freebusy Read URL protocol +
•The new Timezone Service Protocol +
•xCal, the XML format for iCalendar +
•CalWS, the Web Services protocol for calendaring +
•Mobile CalDAV client/server testing +
•Synchronization testing for mobile clients in general
