*CalConnect Adds Two More Top University Members*

*McKinleyville, CA – November 14, 2005 –* Harvard Arts and Sciences
Computer Services and have joined the Calendaring and Scheduling
Consortium +
(www.calconnect.org) to bring the number of university members to twelve. This follows
closely oM and Trumba to the roster of vendor members. CalConnect’s
membership also includes open-source foundations and a research
facility.

“Harvard Arts and Sciences Computer Services realizes that the
complexities of calendaring in the academic world are constantly
expanding,” said Noah Selsby, FAS Computer Services at Harvard. “As a
result we felt it was necessary to begin participating in more industry
events and groups in order to keep on top of the latest developments and
trends.”

Michael Puskar, ITS eServices at NYU, noted, “We joined CalConnect to
help the process of making calendaring as easy as email. We also want to
make calendar information as available as possible, via HTML, RSS, and
iCal, so others can view and use the information as they need it, not as
dictated by the calendar software.”

*The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (www.calconnect.org)* +
The Consortium focuses on the interoperable exchange of calendaring and
scheduling +
information between dissimilar programs, platforms, and technologies.
The mission is to provide mechanisms to allow calendaring and scheduling
methodologies to interoperate,to promote understanding of these
methodologies, and to enable calendaring and scheduling tools and
applications to enter the mainstream of computing. Organizational
members include California State University (Fresno), Carnegie Mellon
University, Dartmouth College, Duke University, EVDB, IBM, Harvard Arts
and Sciences Computer Services, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Meeting
Maker, M.I.T., The Mozilla Foundation, New York University, Novell, Open
Source Application Foundation, Oracle Corporation, Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, Stanford University, Symbian, Trumba, UC
Berkeley, University of Washington, University of Wisconsin Madison, and
Yahoo! Inc. Launched December 2004, the Consortium will hold a series of
interoperability testing events, Roundtables and Technical Committee
meetings to achieve its objectives within a five-year time frame.
