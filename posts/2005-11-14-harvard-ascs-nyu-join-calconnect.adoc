CalConnect Adds Two More Top University Members 
 
McKinleyville, CA – November 14, 2005 – Harvard Arts and Sciences Computer Services and 
New York University have joined the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium 
(www.calconnect.org) to bring the number of university members to twelve. This follows closely 
on the addition of IBM and Trumba to the roster of vendor members. CalConnect’s membership 
also includes open-source foundations and a research facility. 
 
“Harvard Arts and Sciences Computer Services realizes that the complexities of calendaring in 
the academic world are constantly expanding,” said Noah Selsby, FAS Computer Services at 
Harvard. “As a result we felt it was necessary to begin participating in more industry events and 
groups in order to keep on top of the latest developments and trends.” 
 
Michael Puskar, ITS eServices at NYU, noted, “We joined CalConnect to help the process of 
making calendaring as easy as email. We also want to make calendar information as available as 
possible, via HTML, RSS, and iCal, so others can view and use the information as they need it, 
not as dictated by the calendar software.” 
 
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (www.calconnect.org) 
The Consortium focuses on the interoperable exchange of calendaring and scheduling 
information between dissimilar programs, platforms, and technologies. The mission is to provide 
mechanisms to allow calendaring and scheduling methodologies to interoperate,to promote 
understanding of these methodologies, and to enable calendaring and scheduling tools and 
applications to enter the mainstream of computing. Organizational members include California 
State University (Fresno), Carnegie Mellon University, Dartmouth College, Duke University, EVDB, IBM, Harvard Arts and Sciences Computer Services, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Meeting 
Maker, M.I.T., The Mozilla Foundation, New York University, Novell, Open Source Application 
Foundation, Oracle Corporation, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Stanford University, Symbian, 
Trumba, UC Berkeley, University of Washington, University of Wisconsin Madison, and 
Yahoo! Inc. Launched December 2004, the Consortium will hold a series of interoperability 
testing events, Roundtables and Technical Committee meetings to achieve its objectives within a 
five-year time frame.
