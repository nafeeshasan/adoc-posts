Technical Committee of the Consortium has released a paper documenting
the benefits to the Mobile industry of adopting the iCalendar
specification in place of the obsolete vCalendar specification currently
in use.

Calendaring & Scheduling Consortium Paper Specifies How, Why of iCalendar 
Interoperability Issues Squarely Addressed in Freely Available Guidelines 
 
McKinleyville, CA – December 14, 2006 – The Mobile Technical Committee of the 
Calendaring & Scheduling Consortium has released key findings of interoperability tests 
and a questionnaire in “The benefits of iCalendar for the mobile industry.” The 
impetus for the White Paper, which is freely available at www.calconnect.org, came from 
a questionnaire of mobile users about calendaring on mobile devices. One of the key 
findings was that user experience of synchronization was not good enough due to 
problems with reliability and interoperability with desktop applications. The White Paper 
covers how iCalendar provides a solution to these interoperability issues. 
 
The paper does the following: 
• Explains the differences between the vCalendar and iCalendar standards. 
• Identifies the advantages of wider usage of iCalendar. 
• Describes on-going activities to improve calendar interoperability based on iCalendar 
 
“Consumers stand to gain a lot with the adoption of iCalendar,” said Dave Thewlis, 
Executive Director of the Calendaring & Scheduling Consortium (CalConnect). “With 
the work the members of our Technical Committee have done with iCalendar, we now 
have a direct route to interoperability between devices and platforms. It will allow users 
to synchronize data easily between multiple devices and servers, and to see the same set 
of information wherever they look.” 
 
Chris Dudding, Editor of the White Paper, added, “Mobile operating system vendors and 
device manufacturers will benefit from wider adoption of iCalendar. The improved 
interoperability with third party software and server implementations will help consumers 
by synchronizing personal information, such as calendars and to-do lists, even more 
seamlessly.” Dudding is a Technology Architect with Symbian Ltd.  
 
“The benefits of iCalendar continue to improve as ongoing work to clarify and 
simplify the standard continues in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Calsify 
working group,” Thewlis continued. “While vCalendar can no longer evolve, iCalendar 
as a data object format continues to take steps towards being the needed standard data 
object format.” 
 
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (www.calconnect.org)  
The Consortium focuses on the interoperable exchange of calendaring and scheduling  
information between dissimilar programs, platforms, and technologies. The mission is to  
provide mechanisms to allow calendaring and scheduling methodologies to interoperate  
to promote understanding of these methodologies, and to enable calendaring and  
scheduling tools and applications to enter the mainstream of computing. Organizational
