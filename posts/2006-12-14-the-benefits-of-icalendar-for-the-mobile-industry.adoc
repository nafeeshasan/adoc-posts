*The Benefits of iCalendar for the Mobile Industry*: The Mobile
Technical Committee of the Consortium has released a paper documenting
the benefits to the Mobile industry of adopting the iCalendar
specification in place of the obsolete vCalendar specification currently
in use.

*Calendaring & Scheduling Consortium Paper Specifies How, Why of
iCalendar* _Interoperability Issues Squarely Addressed in Freely
Available Guidelines_

*McKinleyville, CA – December 14, 2006 –* The Mobile Technical Committee
of the Calendaring & Scheduling Consortium has released key findings of
interoperability tests and a questionnaire in *“The benefits of
iCalendar for the mobile industry*.” The impetus for the White Paper,
which is freely available at [.underline]#www.calconnect.org#, came from
a questionnaire of mobile users about calendaring on mo[.underline]#bile
devices. One of t#he key findings was that user experience of
synchronization was not good enough due to problems with reliability and
interoperability with desktop applications. The White Paper covers how
iCalendar provides a solution to these interoperability issues.

The paper does the following:

• Explains the differences between the vCalendar and iCalendar
standards.

• Identifies the advantages of wider usage of iCalendar.

• Describes on-going activities to improve calendar interoperability
based on iCalendar

“Consumers stand to gain a lot with the adoption of iCalendar,” said
Dave Thewlis, Executive Director of the Calendaring & Scheduling
Consortium (CalConnect). “With the work the members of our Technical
Committee have done with iCalendar, we now have a direct route to
interoperability between devices and platforms. It will allow users to
synchronize data easily between multiple devices and servers, and to see
the same set of information wherever they look.”

Chris Dudding, Editor of the White Paper, added, “Mobile operating
system vendors and device manufacturers will benefit from wider adoption
of iCalendar. The improved interoperability with third party software
and server implementations will help consumers by synchronizing personal
information, such as calendars and to-do lists, even more seamlessly.”
Dudding is a Technology Architect with Symbian Ltd.

“The benefits of iCalendar continue to improve as ongoing work to
clarify and +
simplify the standard continues in the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) Calsify working group,” Thewlis continued. “While vCalendar can
no longer evolve, iCalendar as a data object format continues to take
steps towards being the needed standard data object format.”

*The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (www.calconnect.org)* +
The Consortium focuses on the interoperable exchange of calendaring and
scheduling information between dissimilar programs, platforms, and
technologies. The mission is to provide mechanisms to allow calendaring
and scheduling methodologies to interoperate to promote understanding of
these methodologies, and to enable calendaring and scheduling tools and
applications to enter the mainstream of computing. Organizational
